        Se√°n William McLoughlin is an Irish youtuber who joined Youtube back in 2007.
        He eventually started his Youtube career under the name "Jacksepticeye" in 2012 by posting a dub of "Solid
        Snake" from the metal gear series.
        From there he started posting let's plays and vlogs as his following amassed.
        Jacksepticeye began growing into that "energetic, bombastic Irish YouTuber" that many people would fall in love
        with.

        Unfortunately, while Jack was still getting his feet off the ground, he did not truely express his Irish origins
        yet.
        He was fearful of being made fun of because of them and decided to hide that aspect of him with an American
        accent.
        It took him time, but as his popularity grew thanks to a shoutout in 2013 from "Pewdiepie",
        a YouTuber who was already very popular even then, he began to embrace his Irish qualities.
        Two years later, he donned his green hair for a charity stream that another YouTuber "Markiplier" started and it
        became a staple of his channel for a long time.
